------------------------
Installs the adb and fastboot binaries for OS X.

Do the following steps:
- Download the zip
- unzip it
- cd to the directory (probably Downloads/minimal_adb_fastboot ) *
- Start the shell script with ./install.sh
- Finished
* Since version 1.1, you can simply call the script with the location, eg /Downloads/minimal_adb_fastboot-master/./install.sh.


Changelog:
---------------
- 1.0	| 15.11.2014 Initial release
- 1.1	| 16.11.2014 Script can now be called from everywhere
- 1.1.1	| 23.11.2014 Name change due to name confict with other adb installer.

Installer Package:
------------------
I also made an installer package (mpkg), which simply moves the binary files into /usr/bin/.
This Package is not signed, which means you have to start it by right-clicking on the mpkg file and select "Open...".

You can find the newest version (Quick Installer Package 1.0, adb version 1.0.32) here:
